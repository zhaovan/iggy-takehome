# Overview

![Image of what the project looks like](public/img.png)

This is a small project for the Iggy Take home designed to help real estate developers or architects figure out and imagine what a location looks like given
a specific address. It has two main goals:

1. Allowing users to query based on address instead of latitude and longitude
2. Allows users to search for specific paramters

One future goal for this is to implement bulk uploading and allow users to see their locations sorted/filtered on a specific paramter to optimize decisions
